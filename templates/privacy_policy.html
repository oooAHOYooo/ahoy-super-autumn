                <h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
                <p>At AHOY Indie Media, we believe privacy is a fundamental right. We've built our platform with privacy-first principles:</p>
                
                <h3>Privacy-First Features We've Implemented:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Self-Hosted Analytics:</strong> We built our own analytics system instead of using Google Analytics or other third-party trackers</li>
                    <li><strong>No Tracking Cookies:</strong> We don't use tracking cookies or pixel tags</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimal Data Collection:</strong> We only collect what's necessary to provide our services</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> All data stays on our servers - we don't share with third parties</li>
                    <li><strong>Anonymized Analytics:</strong> Visitor data is hashed and anonymized before storage</li>
                    <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> We protect against spam and abuse without collecting personal data</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Forms:</strong> All forms use CSRF protection and input validation</li>
                    <li><strong>No Data Selling:</strong> We never sell, rent, or trade your personal information</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why This Matters:</h3>
                <p>Traditional analytics services like Google Analytics collect extensive personal data and track users across the web. We chose a different approach - one that respects your privacy while still helping us understand how to improve our platform for the New Haven arts community.</p>

                <p>Our analytics help us answer questions like "Which events are most popular?" and "When do people visit our site?" without knowing who you are or tracking you elsewhere on the internet.</p>
